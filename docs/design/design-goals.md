# Design goals

The overarching design goals of the project are:

**1: Create a fun exploration experience that does not rely on violence**

Most games that are famous for their "expansive" worlds are also big combat simulations with small bits of social interaction sprinkled in.

Games like Skyrim, for example, do not function if you are not willing to go into combat.

Our goal is to create an experience where the player is able to explore and learn about a fictional world without resorting to violence.

**2: Create a truly non-violent experience**

This means that systems that are not "combat" should still be studied and considered for their violent nature.

A big example is fishing. While it may not sound violent at first, the action of killing an animal involves some degree of violence.

This also means that such concepts should be removed from the in-game world.

**3: Allow the community to extend the game however they want**

Trying to make a game that appeals to everyone is impossible. The approach of 'mod-first' development is not meant to cover or solve the previous point. However, it is a mechanism that allows the community to extend the game in whichever way they see fit with optional modules, allowing niche groups of players to develop experiences that better suit their tastes.

For example, if you as a player enjoy cooking and think the existing cooking minigames are not great, you could improve or completely replace the existing system, then package and share it with the community.

Alternatively, if you do not care about such systems, you may want to replace the cooking minigames with a simple "roll of the dice" system.

The point is, both changes are equally great and target their own slice of the player-base, improving the experience for said slice. This being the case, we should strive to making modding easy.
