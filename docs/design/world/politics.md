# Politics

## Villages

In villages, work is divided between all, and those that are better suited for specific tasks take their roles with pleasure.

Villages always have a representative. This representative is chosen by their peers based on trust and capability.

## Cities

In bigger cities, districts are treated like villages. When decisions must be taken at a city-level, the representatives of each district get together as a council and determine policies, measures and changes.

Usually these councils also have representatives from the nearby villages, mainly as a way to organize the trade of resources and to provide assistance when needed.

## Representatives

It is important to note that being a representative is not a profession. Representatives only stop their regular professions when necessary.
