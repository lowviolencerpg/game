# Magic

Magic is an integral part of the world.

Magic is powered by the caster's spirit (in the form of their breath) and controlled by their vocal abilities.

Magic can be manifested with chanting or songs. Some mages prefer to use flutes to channel their spirit, since that allows them to control it to achieve the necessary notes. The best magicians however, use their own vocal cords to do so.

Magic is not able to materialize anything, only influence the environment around it.

## Magic in society

On cities and villages, magicians are seen as service providers. Healing, farming, cooking and cleaning are professions that magicians often take.

Magic is also part of the [technological](./technology.md) processes for crating various items.
