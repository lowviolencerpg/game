# Inhabitants

The world inhabitants are called fairies. They are anthropomorphic humanoids with magical powers.

Their patterns of lifestyle are diverse: some choose to live in the wilderness, while others stablish villages and cities.

There are 6 types of fairies:

- Boars
- Butterflies
- Foxes
- Lemurs
- Snakes
- Spiders

Each species of fairies have their own physical traits, as well as predispositions. However, no species is relegated to specific tasks.

## Fairies

### Boars

Boars are the bulkiest species.

They have big teeth that stick outside their mouths, a small tail with a hairy end, and are often stronger than other species.

These characteristics makes them predisposed to professions that involve physical strength.

### Butterflies

Butterflies posses colorful wings growing from their shoulder bones. These wings are not able to sustain flight for long distances since they very flexible, some butterflies even fold them down in a cape-like appearance. They also have antennae growing from their foreheads and a very strong sense of smell.

Thanks to these characteristics, they often take professions that leverage their accurate sense of smell, as well as their ability to hover in place.

### Foxes

Foxes have big fluffy ears and tails, as well as very sharp claws. They are the most magically gifted species.

These characteristics lead them to professions where their magic can be used to it's fullest, or, to jobs that require a lot of manual dexterity and small cutting tools, since they are able to use their natural claws instead of knives.

### Lemurs

Lemurs have big eyes that can see in the dark, very capable and dexterous hands. They also have a long, curled, fluffy tail.

They are great at moving at night or doing precision work, naturally their common professions leverage these points.

### Snakes

Snakes have a snake-like lower half, with which they can grab and hold things, as well as poisonous fangs. Some snakes might have scaly skin besides their lower-half.

Their natural poison can be neutralized with magic, and it becomes a great spice for foodstuff.

Because of this, they often take professions where these characteristics can be used.

### Spiders

Spiders have four spider arms/legs attached to their backs at shoulder and hip height, as well as small fangs. Their extra arms and legs are thin and hard, but very mobile.

They can use their arms as auxiliary hands, so they are great at professions where an extra pair of hands helps.

## Lifecycle

The fairies are very closely relate to magic.

The folk believe in reincarnation and that one's spirit, which powers their magical powers, is spread around the world when one passes away.

Magicians are common, but great magicians are rare and are perceived as distinguished citizens.

### Birth

The species of a newborn is not determined by their parent's species. While genetics does play a role, other factors have strong influence.

When a child is conceived, for a short period of time while their spirit is still being formed, the magic manifested around them will affect their species.

This can cause bigger or smaller distributions of specific races, depending on the magic used more commonly on their vicinity. For example, in colder villages, because of the high concentration of heat-generating magic, most newborns are Boars.

### Death

When a person's magic get below a certain threshold, they die. Because magic is the caster's spirit, when it weakens it means the caster is reaching it's limit.

Because magic is essential for the world, this is not viewed as strange, and the folk do not avoid using magic. In fact, a person's death is celebrated, as it means they have done all they could for the world.

Once a person dies, a ceremony is held where the body is burned. The relatives and close friends also bring paper lanters, with personal messages attached to them. These lanterns are scattered to the winds, and represent the deceased's spirit being spread around the world.
