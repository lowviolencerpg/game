# Housing

There are two main factors on where folk end up living:

- How comfortable they are providing for themselves
- How resilient they are to the climate and weather

The first, affects if they live in bigger cities, villages or by themselves; The second affects whether they live in more hospitable regions or in desolate zones (cold mountains, deserts, near volcanos, etc)

## Buildings

Most houses are built with materials that are sourced locally. Usually houses that are near each other use the same style and materials.

Some special buildings may have differentiated shapes or features, suitable for the activities performed inside, or as a way to serve as landmarks. Inns, for example, are notably tall so they can have more rooms available. At the same time, Smiths are usually low and wide, with multiple chimneys.

## Villages and Cities

The main difference between the two is size.

While villages are often rural, and can have from 5 to 30 families, cities can have thousands of families.

This means that villagers usually live a rougher lifestyle, while cities have more comfort.
