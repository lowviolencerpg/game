# Camera

The camera is a 3rd Person camera, positioned behind the character's model.

The player will be able to move the camera to look around, as well as move the camera closer or farther away, up to set distances.

This will allow players to get closer when approaching NPCs, even closer when trying to look for small objects in the world, and further away when exploring big open areas.
